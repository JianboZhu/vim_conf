This is my vim conf files.
.vimrc and _vimrc is for Linux and Windows, respectively.

#### Installation
# 1) For Linux/Unix
  The installation is very simple:
    1. copy .vimrc file in your home directory by executing the following command:
       cp -f .vimrc ~/
    2. Install 'vundle', the vim plugins manager. (Note, you should install git in your computer before doing this.)
       git clone https://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git ~/.vim/bundle/vundle
    3. Open any one of your files, and execute ":BundleInstall" in the vim command model.

# Usage of 'plug-in's
  Please see the wiki of this project.

# 2) For Windows
  The installation is also quite simple: (You can also get some helps from this website: https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim/wiki/Vundle-for-Windows)
    1. copy _vimrc in this depo into your gvim installing path, such as "C:\Program Files (x86)\Vim"
       cp _vimrc C:\Program Files (x86)\Vim
    2. install 'vundle', the vim plugins manager. (Note, you should install git in your computer before doing this.)
        git clone https://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git C:/Users/USERNAME/bundle/vundle
       Note: pls replace the "USERNAME" with your own user name, such as Joe.
    3. Launch gvim, and execute ":BundleInstall" in the vim command model.


Okay, that's pretty much it.
