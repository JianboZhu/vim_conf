This is my vim conf file.

# Installation
  The installation is very simple:
    1. Build .vimrc file in your home directory by executing the following command:
       cp -f .vimrc ~/
    2. Install 'vundle', the vim plugins manager.
       git clone https://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git ~/.vim/bundle/vundle
    3. Open any one of your files, and execute ":BundleInstall" in the vim command model.

# Usage of 'plug-in's
  Please see the wiki of this project.
